The things that you see can be mined, words you hear can be mined, food you eat can be mined, the feelings you feel can be mined!! \n\n### What is mining?\n\nFrom [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining), ~~Data mining (the analysis step of the \"Knowledge Discovery in Databases\" process, or KDD), an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science, is the computational process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and database systems.~~\n\nThats simple definition. Lets make it even more simple.\n\nWhen you see an orange:\n\n![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Orange_and_cross_section.jpg)\n\n#### How do you know its an orange?\n\nWell, I first see the color of object: **Color**\nThen, I smell it: **Odour**\nThen, I taste it: **Taste**\nThis gives me information about what object I have.\n\nThen I will compare it with the things I saw/smelled/ate before and make a decision if it is an orange. *Making a machine do the same is data mining.*\n\n#### How can we make a machine *know* that its an orange?\n\nA machine can be made to think ~~just~~ almost like us. \n\nIt takes three parts to ***know*** something:\n\n1. Have information. \n2. Process information\n3. Decide on that information\n\nWhich is shown in almost every data mining tutorial:\n\n![](http://recommender-systems.readthedocs.org/en/latest/_images/Kdd-process.png)\n\n* Having information = Having **Color**, **Odour**, **Taste** = Selection, Preprocessing.\n* Process information = Comparing with previous eatables = Feature selection and extraction, *Data mining*\n* Deciding = deciding it is an orange = Interpretation and Evaluation\n\nSince, **Color**, **Odour**, **Taste** help model decide which fruit the object is, they are the attributes of model, also called ***independent*** variables.\n\nAs we are predicting for name of fruit, *Name of fruit* is the ***dependent*** variable, which changes according to independent variables.\n\n### Example\n\nNow, if we understand what mining is. Lets try to mine something. \n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>color</th>\n    <th>taste</th>\n    <th>fruitname</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>red</td>\n    <td>sweet</td>\n    <td>apple</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>yellow</td>\n    <td>sweet</td>\n    <td>banana</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>orange</td>\n    <td>sour</td>\n    <td>orange</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>red<br></td>\n    <td>sour</td>\n    <td>strawberry</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nNow if you are only given:\n\n* Color: red\n\nYour model predicts that it could be an apple or strawberry. \n\n### Further Reading\nFor more detailed information, check [here](http://menzies.us/cs573/)","html":"<h2 id=\"miningdatainaminute\">Mining data in a minute</h2>\n\n<p>Data = anything = everything.</p>\n\n<p>Data defines you.</p>\n\n<table class=\"tg\">  \n  <tr>\n    <th class=\"tg-031e\">Limbs</th>\n    <th class=\"tg-031e\">Color</th>\n    <th class=\"tg-031e\">CommonSense</th>\n    <th class=\"tg-031e\">Weight</th>\n    <th class=\"tg-031e\">Species</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">4</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">white</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">yes</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">150</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">Human</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">2</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">white</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">no</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">20</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">Bird</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">8</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">black</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">no</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">0.50</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">Spider</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>Data also defines projects.</p>\n\n<table>  \n  <tr>\n    <th>SLOC</th>\n    <th>acap</th>\n    <th>Complexity</th>\n    <th>Reliability<br></th>\n    <th>Cost</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1000</td>\n    <td>very high<br></td>\n    <td>nominal</td>\n    <td>high</td>\n    <td>250</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>100</td>\n    <td>low</td>\n    <td>high</td>\n    <td>high</td>\n    <td>75</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2000000<br></td>\n    <td>nominal</td>\n    <td>low</td>\n    <td>low</td>\n    <td>1000</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<ul>\n<li>SLOC, acap, Complexity, Reliability are taken from COCOMO attributes.
